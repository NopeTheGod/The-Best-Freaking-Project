  <title>Kostya Trener's BIG family</title>
 </head>
 <body>
   <h1>Kostya Trener's family is so big, that i decided to create a whole new page for it.</h1>
   <h2>Let's begin with his brothers.</h2>
   <p>He has 2 brothers - Vanya and Anrey (Duka)</p>
   <h2>Now let's discuss his parents.</h2>
   <p>His mother's name is Tatiana Vyacheslavovna. She is long-suffering woman because in Dota2 we have an old good tradition - cursing each other's mother's. One way to stop that is saying that you have no mother. Kostya Trener used this method several times, but I hope that his mom is OK with that.</p>
   <p>His father's name is Alexandr Andreevich. I don't know much about him, but he is a cool dude.</p>
